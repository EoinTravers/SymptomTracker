    <h1>Symptom Tracker UK</h1>
    <p>
        In the UK, we're all worried about the coronavirus.
        Unfortunately, due to a lack of of test kits, we don't know
        exactly how many people have been infected. In this
        mini-survey, we're trying to ask people all around the UK
        about any coronavirus-related symptoms they've experienced in
        the last four weeks, so we can have a better idea of the spread of
        the disease.

    <p>
        Importantly, this doesn't work if only sick people complete the survey.
        We need <b>everyone</b>, including those who are <b>currently sick</b>,
        people who have been <b>sick recently</b>, and
        <b>people who don't feel sick at all</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        By filling out this survey, you can help us understand the
        spread of this disease, and do your bit to help stop it.
        <b>It should take about 2 minutes.</b>
        You can complete this survey as many times you like, as your symptoms change,
        but please enter your email address so we know the data is coming from the same person.

    <h2>What happens to your data?</h2>
    <p>
        We will be releasing most of the data collected publicly as soon as possible,
        so that researchers around the world can analyse it and put it to use.
        However, some of the questions ask for personal information, such as your email address or postcode.
        We'll keep this information private.
